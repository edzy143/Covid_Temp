# Covid_Temp

A basic application for members of the company to log their daily temperature readings, as a preventative measure of COVID-19.
The current procedure is that each member needs to manually record their temperatures each morning when arriving at work, and 
again in the afternoonwhen they leave.

The application aims to simplify this process and automatically record temperatures into a database, for immediate viewing.
