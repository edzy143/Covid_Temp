# Covid Temperature Tracking

A basic application for members of the company to log their daily temperature readings, as a preventative measure of COVID-19.
The current procedure is that each member needs to manually record their temperatures each morning when arriving at work, and 
again in the afternoon when they leave.

However, the safety officer is located off-site and needs to collect the datasheets on a weekly basis.

The application aims to simplify this process and automatically record temperatures into a database, for immediate retrieval by
the health & safety officer as well as reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
